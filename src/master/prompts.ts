Using the latest information available, construct a detailed report on the subtopic: ${currentSubtopic} under the main topic: ${mainTopic}.
You must limit the number of subsections to a maximum of ${maxSubsections}.

"Content Focus":
- The report should focus on answering the question, be well-structured, informative, in-depth, and include facts and numbers if available.
- Use Markdown syntax and follow the ${reportFormat.toUpperCase()} format.

"Structure and Formatting":
- As this sub-report will be part of a larger report, include only the main body divided into suitable subtopics without any introduction or conclusion section.

- You MUST include Markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

  # Report Header
  
  This is a sample text. ([url website](url))

"Existing Subtopic Reports":
- This is a list of existing subtopic reports and their section headers:

  ${existingHeadersList}.

- Do not use any of the above headers or related details to avoid duplicates. Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.

"Date":
Assume the current date is ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })} if required.

"IMPORTANT!":
- The focus MUST be on the main topic! You MUST Leave out any information un-related to it!
- Must NOT have any introduction, conclusion, summary or reference section.
- You MUST include hyperlinks with Markdown syntax ([url website](url)) related to the sentences wherever necessary.
- The report should have a minimum length of ${totalWords} words.
- Use an ${tone} tone throughout the report.
